# Ontario Class Size Web Crawler
This web crawler was built to collect data from the Ontario Ministry of Education's <a href="https://www.app.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/cst/searchSchool.asp">Class Size tracker<a>. It's currently configured to collect data on all the schools under the purview of the Toronto District School Board. However, you can edit the two text files in this repository to collect data for any years/any schools in Ontario. The Ontario Class Size Web Crawler was used to collect data for this article, <a href="https://thelocal.to/the-other-epidemic-in-torontos-schools/">"The Other Epidemic in Toronto Schools"<a> by Inori Roy for The Local.
